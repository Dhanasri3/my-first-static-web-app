        <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
        <p>
            This website uses a custom font called "Amita" to style its text content. The font is defined using the
            <code>@font-face</code> rule in the CSS, which specifies the font source and how it should be displayed.
            This custom font enhances the visual appeal of the text on our webpages.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see the custom font in action throughout our website, providing a unique and engaging user
            experience.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Are Serving Fonts</h2>
        <p>
            We understand the importance of typography in web design. To ensure a consistent and visually pleasing
            experience for our visitors, we've chosen a custom font called "Amita". This font is loaded using the
            <code>@font-face</code> rule in our CSS. When a user accesses our website, their browser fetches the
            font file from the specified source, which in this case is "./Amita/Amita-Regular.ttf". The
            <code>font-display: fallback;</code> property ensures that even if the font takes some time to load,
            there won't be a blank space or a flash of unstyled text. Instead, the browser will display fallback fonts
            until our custom font is fully loaded and ready to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            By serving fonts in this manner, we prioritize both design aesthetics and user experience. We believe
            that attention to detail, even in the choice of fonts, contributes to a seamless and enjoyable interaction
            for everyone who visits our website.
        </p>
        <h2>Enhancing User Experience with Custom Fonts</h2>
        <p>
            Typography plays a crucial role in creating a pleasant reading experience. Our choice of the "Amita" font
            reflects our commitment to providing a unique and memorable experience to our visitors. Custom fonts not
            only enhance the visual appeal but also convey the personality of our brand. The elegant curves and
            distinct style of Amita add a touch of sophistication to our content, making it more engaging and enjoyable
            to read.
        </p>
        <h2>Optimizing Font Loading for Performance</h2>
        <p>
            While custom fonts enhance the aesthetics, we also understand the importance of website performance. We
            have optimized the loading of the Amita font to ensure a seamless user experience. By specifying the
            <code>font-display: fallback;</code> property, we strike a balance between design and performance. Our
            website remains fast and responsive while delivering a visually appealing presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are committed to continuously improving our website, ensuring that it not only looks great but also
            performs optimally. Our choice of fonts and the way we serve them are just a few examples of the thought
            and care we put into crafting a superior online experience for our audience.
